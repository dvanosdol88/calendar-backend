# Anti-Hallucination Safeguard System

## Overview
This system prevents the AI assistant from making false claims about capabilities it doesn't have. It validates all AI responses before sending them to users and rewrites responses containing false capability claims with honest alternatives.

## Problem Solved
The AI was previously making false claims such as:
- "I've added 'Zoom with Stacy Rankin' to your calendar" (NO calendar integration exists)
- "I've sent the email" (NO email sending capability)
- Other false capability claims

## System Components

### 1. AntiHallucinationFilter (`anti-hallucination-filter.js`)
Core filtering engine that:
- Maintains capability whitelist (what the system CAN do)
- Defines detection patterns for false claims
- Rewrites responses with honest alternatives
- Provides confidence scoring

#### Actual Capabilities (✅ Available):
- Task management (add, complete, delete, edit, list)
- Conversation memory and context
- Task clarification (A/B/C choices)
- General AI assistance and planning

#### NOT Available (❌ Blocked):
- Calendar integration (not implemented)
- Email sending (not implemented)
- File system access beyond tasks
- External API calls except tasks
- Real-time notifications
- Phone/SMS integration
- Document creation

### 2. Pattern Detection System
Sophisticated regex patterns detect false claims:

**Calendar Claims:**
- "I've added to your calendar"
- "I'll schedule the meeting for tomorrow"
- "Calendar event has been created"

**Email Claims:**
- "I've sent the email"
- "I'll email the team"
- "Notification has been delivered"

**File System Claims:**
- "I've saved the report"
- "I'll create the document"

**Phone/SMS Claims:**
- "I've called Sarah"
- "I'll text Mike"

### 3. Response Rewriting
When false claims are detected, responses are rewritten with honest alternatives:

**Before:** "I've added Zoom with Stacy Rankin to your calendar for 4:30 PM"
**After:** "I don't have calendar access yet, but I can add 'Zoom with Stacy Rankin at 4:30 PM' as a task reminder. Would you like me to do that?"

### 4. Integration Points

#### Main Endpoint (`index.js`)
```javascript
// Apply filter to task responses
const filteredTaskResponse = antiHallucinationFilter.filterResponse(
    taskResult.aiResponse, 
    { strict: true }
);

// Apply filter to general AI responses  
const filteredGeneralResponse = antiHallucinationFilter.filterResponse(
    assistantResponse, 
    { strict: false }
);
```

#### System Prompts Enhanced
Updated system prompts in `context-manager.js` and `ai-task-assistant.js` to include capability restrictions.

### 5. API Endpoints

#### Get Capabilities: `GET /api/capabilities`
Returns system capabilities and filter status.

#### Test Filter: `POST /api/test-filter`
Test endpoint for validating filter behavior.

```javascript
{
  "text": "I've sent an email to John",
  "strict": true
}
```

## Testing

### Comprehensive Test Suite (`anti-hallucination-test.js`)
- 18 test scenarios covering all false claim types
- Pattern matching validation
- Success rate: 100%
- Demonstrates filter with example claims

### Run Tests:
```bash
node anti-hallucination-test.js
```

## Response Metadata
All responses now include filter metadata:

```javascript
{
  "answer": "Filtered response text",
  "antiHallucinationFilter": {
    "wasFiltered": true,
    "confidence": 85,
    "issues": [
      {
        "capability": "calendarIntegration",
        "severity": "high",
        "pattern": "I've added.*calendar"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Configuration

### Strict vs Non-Strict Mode
- **Strict Mode** (task responses): Rewrites all detected false claims
- **Non-Strict Mode** (general responses): Adds disclaimers for medium-severity issues

### Confidence Scoring
- High confidence issues (90%+): Automatic rewrite
- Medium confidence: Confirmation required
- Scoring based on severity and number of issues

## Benefits

1. **Prevents User Confusion**: Users no longer receive false promises
2. **Builds Trust**: Honest communication about actual capabilities
3. **Provides Alternatives**: Suggests task-based workarounds
4. **Maintains Functionality**: Doesn't break existing features
5. **Transparent**: Filter status is visible in responses

## Example Transformations

### Calendar Integration
❌ **Before:** "I've scheduled your dentist appointment for next Tuesday"
✅ **After:** "I can't access your calendar directly, but I can add 'Dentist appointment next Tuesday' as a task reminder. Would you like me to do that?"

### Email Sending
❌ **Before:** "I've emailed the team about the project update"
✅ **After:** "I don't have email capabilities, but I can add 'Email team about project update' as a task reminder."

### File Creation
❌ **Before:** "I've saved the report as 'Q4_Report.pdf' on your desktop"
✅ **After:** "I don't have file access, but I can add 'Create Q4_Report.pdf' as a task reminder."

## Future Enhancements

1. **Machine Learning**: Train model to detect more subtle false claims
2. **Context Awareness**: Better understanding of implied capabilities
3. **User Feedback**: Allow users to report missed false claims
4. **Integration Expansion**: Add actual capabilities as they're implemented

## Monitoring

The system logs all filter activities and provides metrics on:
- False claim detection rate
- Response rewrite frequency
- User interaction with filtered responses
- Pattern matching accuracy

This ensures the AI assistant remains honest, helpful, and trustworthy while providing clear alternatives for unsupported features.
